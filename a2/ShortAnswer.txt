1. Looking at the top errors printed by get_top_misclassified, name two ways you would modify your classifier to improve accuracy (it could be features, tokenization, or something else.)

A.
  Two ways to modify classifier are:
   1.Count/Density:
      Adding the sentence count, punctuation count, this will increase the broadening of the features of the model.
   2.Increasing the combinations of the features we have taken:
   
   
2. Implement one of the above methods. How did it affect the results?

A. I have added few more increments for features by increasing the count which will furthur seggregate the features granualarly. 
    
    But i could not find great influence on the accuracy.
